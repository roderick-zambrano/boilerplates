# Dockge

## Requirements

1. Docker Socket (r/w to spin containers up)

## Setup

Straightforward, just run the container with the compose file.

## Configuration

`Not required`

## Notes

One might be tempted to try to restart this container within itself. Since that does not work, simply run the provided script that automates the bringing down and bringing up of the docker container in one single call instead of having to type it all out.
