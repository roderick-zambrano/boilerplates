# Dockge

## Requirements

`None`

## Setup

Straightforward, just run the container with the compose file.

## Configuration

`Not required`

## Notes

One might be tempted to try to restart this container within itself. Since that does not work, I simply added a script that automates the bringing down and bringing up of the docker container in one single call instead of having to type it all out.
